SpeechMap
=============

This is a prototypical demo showing how to control a map using natural speech interaction. 
Check out the [Demo](http://speechmap.herokuapp.com/)!

UPDATE: Based on a set of API changes, the demo doesn't work anymore!


Possible Interactions so far:
----
* panning
* zooming
* creating markers
* drawing lines


Try to use sentences like: 
----
* "Move to San Francisco"
* "Draw a marker in America"
* "Set a point in chicago"
* "Connect Los Angeles and San Francisco"
* "Zoom in"
* "Pan up"
* "Pan to the left"


Hints/ Problems: 
----
* Based on the geocoder only locations in America are useful
* The webkit speech recognition seems to randomly stop, which is why it asks repeadetly for permissions




Based on:
----
 
* [Leaflet](leafletjs.com) 
* [Wit](https://wit.ai/) for the natural speech recognition
* [mapquest](developer.mapquest.com) for the geocodings
